You are training a naive Bayes classifier, where the number of possible labels, |Y| = 3 and the dimension of the data element, |X| = 100, 
where every feature (dimension) is binary. 

- How many parameters does the naive Bayes classification model have?

- A Naive Bayes Classifier has two kinds of parameters:
1. Pr(y) for every u in Y: so if |Y| = 3, there are three such parameters. -- Prior Probability
2. Pr(x_i|y) for every binary feature x_i in X and y in Y. Specifically, for a particular feature x_1, the parameters are Pr(x_1=1|y) and Pr(x_1=0|y) for every y.
   So if |X| = 100 binary features and |Y| = 3, there are (2 x 100) x 3 = 600 such features.
Hence in all, there are 603 parameters.

Note that not all of these features are independent. In particular, Pr(x_i=0|y) = 1-Pr(x_i=1|y), for every x_i and y.
So, there are only 300 independent parameters of this kind (as the other 300 parameters are just complements of these).
Similarly, the sum of all prior probabilities Pr(y) should be 1. These means there are only 2 independent prior probabilities. 
In all, for this example, there are 302 independent parameters.
